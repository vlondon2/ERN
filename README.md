# Emergency Response Network

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to access the web app online, then create an account or sign into an existing account.

Once you have an account, you can use the app to report an emergency, either by messaging/calling nearby volunteers or directly reporting the emergency in the app. If the emergency is dire or major, you will be given the option to call 911 or your emergency contact, which can be stored on the app.

The app uses Twilio to send messages to users and volunteers, meaning that help can be contacted at the push of a button.
